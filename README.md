The app will interactively take a string representing a simple mathematical expression from the user
(e.g. “12435+34569-12345*10+50”).
After the user inputs the string, the app will check if the string represents a valid expression (no unexpected string characters, no duplicate operation characters, etc.).
After validating the expression, the app will output a string containing the result.
 In case of invalid expression, it should output an appropriate error message.
For simplicity, we will consider only addition, subtraction, and multiplication operations.
Also, we will only consider integers.
